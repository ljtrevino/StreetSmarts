<h2>Overview</h2>
    
<p>StreetSmarts is a series of smart street lights that can be used to map optimal routes emergency responders should through take though a city.  Let's say there's a guy named Joe who witnesses a nearby car crash where both cars involved catch on fire.  Joe forgot his phone at work, so he runs toward the nearest smart street lamp and yells "FIRE, FIRE, FIRE".  When the lamp unit detects motion, it begins recording and uses his voice commands to contact the nearest fire department.  At the Cambridge Fire Station, a woman named Stephanie accepts the request for help and sends a team of firefighters to help.  After running an algorithm to determine the quickest route to the car crash, the street lamps along that route light up.  This helps the firefighters know where to go, and also alerts drivers that an emergency vehicle will be coming soon so that they can clear the way for the emergency vehicle.  In record time, the firefighters reach the crash site, extinguish the fire, and save the lives of the people in the cars.</p>

<u><h2> The Miniature Map </h2></u>
    
<p>The mini map is a model indicating which street lamps would light up in the shortest path to an emergency location.  It is an actual map of the area north of the MIT campus along Massachuestts Avenue.</p>
    
<h4> Fabrication </h4>
    <p>The map itself was laser raster engraved and the box below was laser cut. All the faces except the top face of the box are glued together so that the wiring and ESP can easily be accessed by lifting off the top of the box.  The holes for the LEDs are also laser cut.</p>
